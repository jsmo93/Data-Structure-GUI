# Milestone 2 README
### Milestone 2 Requirements:
* Completed drawing algorithm code - Found in Table-Construction.rkt
* Completed saving algorithm code - Found in Table-Deconstruction.rkt
* Completed collision algorithm code - Merged with drawing algorithm
* At this point, a data structure should be completely drawable in the Racket - Found in Data-Structure-GUI-Core.rkt. Documentation is provided in Documentation.md

### Files:
* Data-Structure-GUI-Core.rkt - The main interface
* Diagram-Components.rkt - Contains the diagram images used to draw a structure
* Diagram-Drawing.rkt - Contains the drawing procedures for a given table
* Table-Construction.rkt - Contains the table building procedure for a given data structure
* Table-Core-Utils.rkt - Contains counting procedures, table manipulation procedures, and accessors
* Table-Deconstruction.rkt - Contains the list building procedure for a given table
* Table-Sorting.rkt - Contains the sorting procedures for a given table
* Sandbox.rkt - Currently a sandbox for interacting with the Data-Structure-GUI-Core
